            <h1 class="about">About Shanthi</h1>
            <br>
            <p class="text">Shanthi is a young woman who has Downs Syndrome with lifelong medical problems. She has not let this inhibit her in anyway and has since the age of nine let her star shine by letting her abilities play a dominant role in the way she lives her life.
                <br>
                <br>
                She is very shy and takes a while to warm up to people. It is when she dances, sings , plays the piano or recorder or performs in general that she sparkles.
                <br>
                <br>
                For Shanthi Indian classical dancing is front and centre in her life. Shanthi has been a dance devotee since 9 years of age and has performed at numerous public events including:
                <br>
                • Harmony Day Celebrations
                <br>
                • Navarathri celebrations Murugan Temple, Kwinana
                <br>
                • Telugu Association of WA celebrations
                <br>
                • Rowethorpe Aged Care Centre
                <br>
                • Social Inclusion Forum - Disability Services Commission
                <br>
                • A multicultural Festival coordinated by the Gosnells City Council
                <br>
                • Disability Services Commission Launch of DVD - Our Voices, Our Journeys 2010
                <br>
                • Disability Day Celebrations for National Disability Services at Burswood Ballroom Perth
                <br>
                <br>
                Shanthi experiences acute anxiety; she has difficulty with change, difficulty in crowds and difficulty leaving the house. The only time Shanthi ventures out and becomes an active participant in community is in the context of performing where she conquers all fear to perform to audiences of up to 500 - she is proud, professional and unflinching.
                <br>
                <br>
                This has not been an easy journey so for Shanthi. The impact of Shanthi’s daily needs and medical care has added a lot pressure on Shanthi and the family.
                Despite all that Shanthi goes through on a daily basis health wise, she takes great pleasure in her dancing as well as creative activities. What started out as a form of therapy has become, to all our delight and amazement, her passion that centres her.
                <br>
                <br>
                Dance is Shanthi's life, it's history and cultural significance her source of lifelong learning, it's performance the foundation of her sense of self and pride and her wish to teach - her future.
                <br>

                Thank you,
                <br>
